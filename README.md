# Rank-order-Assignment-Algorithm

## Project Description

This project assigns doctors to hospitals based on their preference lists by making use of the Rank-Maximal Matching algorithm, a method for assigning applicants to positions in a way that maximizes satisfaction based on preference rankings. This method aims to produce a matching that favors as many first-choice assignments as possible, then second-choice assignments, and so on. 

## Background & Motivation

The challenge of the Resident-Hospital matching problem is to design an assignment that is fair and efficient. 
The Rank-Maximal Matching approaches this challenge by prioritizing the maximization of high-preference assignments in a hierarchical fashion:

1. First, it maximizes the number of first-choice matches
2. With first-choice matches constant at maximum, maximize second-choice matches
3. Continue for all ranks

By maximizing first-choice matches before considering lower-ranked options, the Rank-Maximal method maximizes overall satisfaction over individual guarantees. It places as many people as possible into their top preferences even if a few participants may end up with less favorable outcomes than they could have gotten. 

## Installation/Requirements

Python v.3.13.7

Required packages: PuLP, NumPY, Pandas, MatPlotLib, argparse

## Usage

### Inputting Data

The code takes in two .xlsx files. To run the code, run the following:

```python rank_matching.py --prefs <path> --caps <path>```

The first one, prefs, should have two columns: Resident Names/IDs, and their respective preferences, which should be lists separated by commas and ordered in order of preference. 

The second one, caps, should have two columns: Hospital Names/IDs, and their respective capacities.

See Demo script for example datasets.

### Output

rank_matching.py should output the following

- A status line from PuLP confirming the LP's status result (Final Status: Optimal)
- Number of Residents Loaded
- Number of Hospitals Loaded
- Total matches
- The number of residents matched for each rank

It will save the resident-hospital assignments to a CSV file, results.csv. 

## Algorithm Details

### Problem Description

In order to approach this via Linear Programming, we first define the Rank-Maximal method mathematically:

- Let doctors be indexed by *i ‚àà {1, ‚Ä¶, N}*  
- Let hospitals be indexed by *j ‚àà {1, ‚Ä¶, M}*  
- Decision variable:  
  - *x·µ¢‚±º = 1* if doctor *i* is assigned to hospital *j*, 0 otherwise.  
- Preference indicator:  
  - Œ¥<sub>ij</sub><sup>(r)</sup> = 1 if doctor *i* ranked hospital *j* as rank *r*, 0 otherwise.  

The algorithm proceeds sequentially:  
1. First, maximize the number of rank-1 matches:  

   ![formula](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\sum_{j=1}^{M}\sum_{i=1}^{N}x_{ij}\delta_{ij}^{(1)})  

   Let this maximum be K‚ÇÅ.  

2. Next, maximize the number of rank-2 matches, subject to the constraint that exactly K‚ÇÅ rank-1 matches are preserved.  

3. Continue sequentially for higher ranks.  

The final solution is represented by a "rank-maximal signature":  
[p‚ÇÅ, p‚ÇÇ, ‚Ä¶] = [K‚ÇÅ, K‚ÇÇ, ‚Ä¶],  
where each K·µ£ is the number of matches achieved at rank *r*.

### Approach (Linear Programming)

The algorithm can be framed as a series of linear programs:

- **Step 1:** Identify all rank-1 preference edges.  
- **Step 2:** Solve an LP to maximize the number of matches using only those edges.  
- **Step 3:** Lock those matches and move on to rank-2 edges, adding them as new constraints.  

**Example:**  

| Doctor | Rank 1 | Rank 2 | Rank 3 |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| A      | X      | Y      | Z      |
| B      | Y      | X      | Z      |
| C      | X      | Z      | Y      |

- Rank-1 edges: {(A, X), (B, Y), (C, X)}  
- Rank-2 edges: {(A, Y), (B, X), (C, Z)}  

Maximization is performed in stages, ensuring earlier rank matches remain fixed as new ranks are considered.

### Exploitable List Lengths

A challenge arises when doctors rank different numbers of hospitals:

- Doctors may list up to 300 hospitals, but can rank fewer.  
- This may unfairly reward shorter lists.  

**Example:**  
- Doctor A: ranks X then Y.  
- Doctor B: ranks only X.  

If both want X, the algorithm may assign:  
- X ‚Üí B (rank 1)  
- Y ‚Üí A (rank 2)  

This creates a signature of [1,1], which is ‚Äúbetter‚Äù than [1,0].  
As a result, the algorithm incentivizes participants to submit shorter preference lists, which is undesirable.  

---

**Fix: Dummy Hospital**

To remove this exploit, we introduce a dummy hospital called `"None"`:  

- `"None"` has infinite capacity.  
- Any doctor who does not match to a real hospital is automatically matched to `"None"`.  
- `"None"` is always treated as the next rank option.  

**Example:**  
- Doctor A: X, Y  
- Doctor B: X, None  

Now, if B does not get X, they are matched to `"None"`, which counts as their rank-2 option.  

This ensures fairness:  
- (A, Y), (B, X)  
- (A, X), (B, None)  
are considered equally valid outcomes.  

üëâ This modification encourages ranking more hospitals, removing the incentive to submit artificially short lists.
